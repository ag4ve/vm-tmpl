This is used to create a minimal virtual machine (template) that can be cloned in order to bring up guests quickly.

REQUIREMENTS:
* multistrap
* schroot
* qemu-img
* qemu-nbd
* nbd-client

You'll need to move the schroot.conf file under /etc/schroot/chroot.d/ or put it into your /etc/schroot/schroot.conf file. You'll also need to edit the schroot.conf file so that it allows your username access to the chroot.

Large portions of this are based on what i found here:
